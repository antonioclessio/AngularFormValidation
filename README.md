# AngularFormValidation

This is just a sample of my coding style.
This project doesn't have a real function.

The idea here is just to show how to do a good form validation in angular.
This sample can be improved creating custom validations to custom fields like CPF, that is a brazillian document (an ID).

If you have questions, feel free to send me a message.
